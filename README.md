### Forked from [MP3Martin/InputInterceptor-PersonalFork](https://github.com/MP3Martin/InputInterceptor-PersonalFork),  
which added bool returns to [0x2E757](https://github.com/0x2E757) @ https://github.com/0x2E757/InputInterceptor/  
C# wrapper for Francisco Lopes' mouse and keyboard [Interception API](https://www.oblita.com/interception.html)

#### This fork
- modified the [`CallbackAction` delegate](blob/master/InputInterceptor/Classes/Hook.cs#L13)
 to also pass numeric [`Context` and `device`](blob/master/InputInterceptor/Classes/Hook.cs#L68),  
 enabling callbacks to selectively divert devices.
- modified Initialize() to detect null bytes from missing/defective `interception_x*.dll`,  
 instead returning false

#### This branch:&nbsp; `stripped`
- remove `install-interception.exe` and other stuff not needed for SimHub plugin
- remove callback `context` argument

#### Note!
- A [WPF XAML](https://github.com/blekenbleu/WPF_XAML) app directly accessing this `static class`
 [crashes](https://github.com/blekenbleu/InputIntercept/blob/3193937a7edbd6268ef19ec5ab6afa3079a4ac36/InputInterceptor/InputInterceptor.cs#L24)  
	- until delayed after [`InputInterceptor.Initialize()`](https://github.com/blekenbleu/InputIntercept/blob/3193937a7edbd6268ef19ec5ab6afa3079a4ac36/InputInterceptor/InputInterceptor.cs#L45)
- This crash <i>did not</i> occur in a [console app](https://github.com/blekenbleu/InterceptMouse), go figure.
	- [This *non-static* class](https://github.com/blekenbleu/InterceptMouse/blob/class/Intercept.cs) insulates using applications from this `static class`.

### How-To
- `SetFilter(context, predicate, filter)`  
	- `context`, returned by `CreateContext()` is information about known keyboards and mice.  
		attaching or releasing one will not be detected without re-running `CreateContext()`  
	- `predicate` is a device filtering routine, taking `device` as an argument  
		and returning true if that device is interesting.  
		For example:&nbsp; `return (12 == device);` // second mouse  
		Sadly, these must be C routines, not C# methods;  
		only `interception_is_mouse` and `interception_is_keyboard` are available.  
		Filtering to a single device must be done in the callback.
	- `filter` is a keyboard or mouse event bitmask; see `Enums.cs`  
		Since we are interested in all events for a selected mouse, this would be MouseFilter.All
